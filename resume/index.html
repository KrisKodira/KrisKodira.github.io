                            Hello, my name is Kristijan Jurcic. You can also call me Kris. 
                            I am a developer and I live in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. 
                            I was born in Croatia but I have been living in Germany since I can think.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I speak Croatian, English and German fluently. 
                            I have a Fachabitur in the technical direction. 
                            The "Fachabitur" is a certificate entitling students to study at a University of Applied Sciences. 
                            During my Fachabitur I did a year-long apprenticeship. 
                            The first half of my apprenticeship I was a IT apprentice at a recruitment company and the second half I was a web development apprentice at an advertisement agency.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my free time I enjoy travelling the world, gaming, working out at the gym, listening to music, coding and riding my motorcycle.
                        </p>

                            <p>
                                With HTML and SCSS I create the mostly static part of all the websites and Electron applications. 
                                Except for the CSS animations that I mix in here and there.
                                As of now I have an advanced knowledge about HTML, CSS and SCSS.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                With JavaScript I create a lot of web games using Pixi.js and Phaser. 
                                For HTML DOM related manipulations I use jQuery because it makes everything a little more convenient and shorter.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I created projects with React and Gatsby at work. Most of them are together with forestry or once we also connected Wordpress to Gatsby and
                                used Wordpress as a headless CMS.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Most of my backends are built using PHP and whenever I am dealing with a database I use prepared statements in PHP. 
                                Only a few backends I made are written with Node.js.
                                TWIG is a templatimg language that works wonderfully with PHP and is used by Grav and Craft CMS for frontend templating.

                                With PHP and SQL I query through all the database entries containing the information that needs to be delivered to the Frontend.

                                        With the new job opportunity I took at Vier für Texas I learned a whole lot of new things.
                                        First thing was that we are using Git and GitLab for version control.
                                        I was used to using Git for personal projects but never for professional projects with a big team of developers.
                                        Also I learned a lot more about TWIG since we are using Craft CMS 2 and 3 for a lot of our clients. It's the best CMS in my opinion since it's extremely flexible
                                        and can also be used for static sites. Other than that I learned Jekyll, Webpack, Kanban, GitLab CI/CD, NPM, working in a bigger team and a lot more API stuff.

                                        During my time as a web developer at Agonist GmbH I learned a lot more about PHP, TypeScript, Flexbox and Bootstrap than I have during my apprenticeship here.
                                        Now I only work on real projects for our current customers.
                                        A notable project I worked on was for an furniture shop where I used HTML, CSS, SCSS, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery and SQL.
                                        I created a backend for the CEO of the company where they can easily remove, edit and add new furniture that was on sale to their site.
                                        I also managed a web project and I needed to make sure that all the updates for the website were on time every two weeks.

                                        Before I started my apprenticeship at Agonist GmbH the only things I knew there basic HTML, CSS and Python.
                                        At Agonist I learned a lot about more advanced HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, SQL and Prepared Statements.
                                        In my first few weeks at Agonist I built a Hangman game, a quiz, a form with validation, a highscore board, a number guessing game and a backend for all these games.
                                        After these first few weeks I started working with the rest of the team on some simple maintenance for other websites and after about a month or two I made my first website.
                                        I also learned how to do responsive design with CSS media queries.

                                        I got a Udemy course where I could learn some simple web development and whenever I didn't learn something about web development, I was working on the IT infrastructure at tayfunRecruitment.
                                        I connected all the PCs there so they can work with each other and easily share files and folders between them through the LAN network.
                                        I was also responsible for maintaining the Wordpress website.

                                        Together with the apprenticeships I got my Fachabitur.
                                        My two main subjects were Biology and English.

                                    A Blog I made using Gatsby, React and Markdown. Loading times are super fast and all the pages get preloaded.
                                    I write the content in Forestry and once I save, Forestry commits my Markdown and then GitHub Actions builds the page and uploads it to my pages branch.

                                <p>
                                    For Codevember #5 the theme was "Sword" and I had a fun little idea where a player and a monster would fight against each other on an island.
                                    So I challenged myself to get the most basic game going I could in one day using Pixi.js and JavaScript.
                                    I finished it and even had enough time to add a day/night cycle with stars floating through the sky whenever it was night and with a cloud blocking the sunlight during the day if it is over the sun.

                                <p>
                                    For Codevember #6 the theme was "Storm" and I decided to create a little character standing on an island with an umbrella.
                                    A dark cloud floats through the scene and it produces some rain.
                                    Every now and then it emits lightning strikes.
                                    Once the rain hits the umbrella the umbrella moves the rain droplets away from the character and when they reach the edge it starts falling downwards again.

                                    At work I sometimes get files that I need to upload to a server so someone else can download it. 
                                    Whenever I get the files, the files sometimes have spaces, weird characters and so on inside them.
                                    So I always used to rename these files by hand.
                                    Once I was at home I decided to write a little Electron application that renames these files and makes them "Server safe".
                                    The application also checks if the new filename that it generates already exists in that folder.
                                    If it does it appends a dash (-) and a number to it.
                                    If the number also already exists it increases the number until it doesn't exist anymore.
                                    This is just a safety mechanism so you don't overwrite your files.
                                    The application also has a darkmode, a setting for not editing the letter casing and a setting for not removing spaces.
                                    All the settings get safed on your local device so you don't have to reset them every time.

                                <p>
                                    A friend of mine is very good at electrical engineering.
                                    He saw my Instagram profile and asked me if I know how to code in C++.
                                    I told him no I don't but what is it about? 
                                    I will figure it out.
                                    He told me he wants to build a electrical longboard and he needs some code so he can change the speed with a remote control.
                                    I told him to give me his two arduinos set one up with a lamp (where I could change the light intensity) and I needed the remote from him.
                                    So he got all that together and I started coding at home.
                                    I was so fascinated once I could change the intensity of the light with the remote.
                                    I gave him the code and now he has a electrical longboard.

                                <p>
                                    I wanted a simple backupscript where I can back up all the directories I need.
                                    I didn't want an usual backup program since I like switching my flavour of Linux every now and then.
                                    So I wrote a backupscript that was executed on every startup.
                                    It mounts another HDD and copies all the files I need to it.
                                    Once it's done copying it zips up the folder.
                                    Every time when it started running it checked if there was a monthly backup made for this month.
                                    If it was it made a daily backup and if not it made a monthly backup.
                                    Once a daily backup was older than 30 days it deleted the old backup.
                                    The monthlies always persisted and they never got deleted.
